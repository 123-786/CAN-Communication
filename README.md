# CAN-Communication
###	Description Implemented a CAN protocol-based communication system between two development boards (N1 and N2), enabling real-time LED control and bi-directional data transfer </br>

**Technical Highlights:** </br>
o	Implemented CAN communication for LED control and data exchange between two dev boards using Data and Remote Frames.</br>
o	Used interrupt-driven programming and activation filters for efficient message handling and reduced latency.</br>
o	Integrated GPIO for LED response and button-triggered data transmission, with HAL libraries for CAN peripheral configuration.</br>
**Software Tools:** STM32CubeIDE, STM32CubeMX </br>
**Hardware Platforms:** STM32F446 Microcontroller </br>
